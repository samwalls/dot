# Python Templates

Templates and useful things for python projects.

##### Makefile
A makefile which can make a python virtual environment automatically.

For an empty project, use `make requirements`, and to rebuild the virtual environment in an already existing project, use `make`.

One can also use `make test` to run all files ending in `_test.py` with python unittest.
